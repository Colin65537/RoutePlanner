Issues with OpenSpace/Javascript/JQuery
The Javascript/jQuery code illustrates a UI updating problem. 
There is a progress bar which should go gradually from 0% to 100% width during a (pointless) calculation. 
But it only appears at the end of the calculation showing 100%. 
Similarly the input box doesn't show any output until completion of the loop. 
How can I get the progress bar (and, less importantly, the input box) to show during the loop execution?
